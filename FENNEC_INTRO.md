# Meet Fennec 🦊

## The Framework

**Fennec** is a lightweight, fast, and agile Python backend framework for building modern REST APIs.

## The Inspiration

Named after the **Fennec fox** (*Vulpes zerda*) - a small, swift, and incredibly adaptable fox native to the Sahara Desert and North Africa, including Tunisia 🇹🇳.

### Why the Fennec Fox?

The Fennec fox is:
- **The smallest fox species** - Just like our minimal, lightweight framework
- **Incredibly fast** - Like our async/await performance
- **Highly adaptable** - Survives in harsh desert conditions, just as our framework adapts to any project
- **Smart and resourceful** - Uses its large ears to hear prey underground, like our framework's excellent error detection
- **Native to Tunisia** - Proud representation of North African tech talent

## The Logo

Our logo features a geometric Fennec fox with the Tunisian flag 🇹🇳, representing:
- **Modern design**: Clean, geometric, professional
- **Tunisian pride**: Showcasing North African innovation
- **Forward-looking**: The fox faces forward, symbolizing progress
